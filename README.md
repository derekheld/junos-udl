User-defined language for Junos® config file editing in Notepad++

* This language formatting is automatically applied to any file ending with the extension .junos
* It was designed to be used with a dark theme, so some of the colors would make readability very hard with backgrounds like white.
* Remember to edit the specified background color to match your theme!
